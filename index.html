                        <p>For the past year, I have been working as a PHP developer at Needle Software Company. During
                            my time there, I gained
                            valuable experience in web development and honed my programming skills. However, as I
                            progressed in my career, I
                            realized that my true passion lies in JavaScript and its various frameworks and libraries.
                        </p>
                        <p>My experiences in PHP development have been enriching, but I am now fully committed to
                            transitioning my career toward
                            becoming a JavaScript-focused developer.</p>
                        <p>I am confident that my ability to learn quickly and adapt to new technologies, and my strong
                            problem-solving skills will
                            make me an asset to any JavaScript development team.</p>
                        <p>I have a deep passion for coding, and I am committed to continuous learning and professional
                            growth.</p>

                    <p>I am a student enrolled at the Informatics College in Armenia, currently pursuing my fourth
                        academic year. As part of my
                        academic curriculum, I am actively seeking an exceptional internship opportunity that aligns
                        with my field of study.

                    <p>
                        Throughout my educational journey at the college, I have acquired a comprehensive set of
                        technical skills that will
                        undoubtedly contribute to any internship role. These skills include expertise in various
                        programming languages, such as
                        Visual Basic, C#, JavaScript (JS), and PHP, enabling me to develop efficient and innovative
                        software solutions.
                        Additionally, I possess proficiency in essential web technologies, namely HTML and CSS, which
                        empowers me to create
                        captivating and user-friendly web applications.</p>
